                <div>Our team relies on each athlete's registration dues to pay for meet registration fees, transportation, warm-ups and t-shirts, team snacks, coaching stipends, the awards banquet, etc.</div>
                <div class="text-blue-600">This year's registration dues will be $250. This amount does not include the team uniform, which is an additional $50.</div>
                <div>Please make checks out to LHS Track Booster Club. Don't forget to include the athlete's name on the check, especially if their last name is different from the parent's.</div>

                <div>Checks can be given to Coach Tigue directly, either at practice or during the day (room 2302).</div>

                <div>Alternatively, checks can be mailed to:
                    <p class="pl-3">8130 Royal Troon Trace</p>
                    <p class="pl-3">Duluth, GA 30097</p>
                </div>

                <div>Because we rely on the dues to set our budget, we ask that they be paid by Friday, January 14th.</div>
